# Correlation and Chi-squared Test Analysis

Project Part 2: Data Preprocessing
Learning objectives:

1. To examine missing data and evaluate different approaches to deal with missing data. Removing or imputing missing data from a dataset is always a risky step as it may skew the data distribution. Students need to provide sufficient rationale when they remove or impute missing data. 
2. To test for correlation or independence between categorical variables and between continuous variables.  Detecting relationships between variables may be interesting findings on its own, and it can also be useful to identify redundant attributes in a dataset. 
3. To concisely summarize the main findings that are supported by the analyses.  
4. Students are expected to select appropriate methods for their analysis and objectively apply the methods so that the analysis and results do not contain major flaws or biases.  When unexpected results are obtained, use another method to verify the findings.
